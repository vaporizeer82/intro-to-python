# Yes, you could just create these basic shapes with the "correct" XYs, but we'll use a matrix to transform the
# basic shape (square, wedge) to the correct size and shape.
#
# This is actually what most packages (eg, solidworks) do when you make a model. Each part of the model is defined
# in a "canonical" location, then transformed to the desired position/scale/rotation using a matarix. This is
# *before* calculating the matrix that positions the part based on the, eg, joint angles
#
# For all of these, you should be creating a matrix that consists of a scale followed by a rotate (maybe) followed by a translate
# See slides for what the resulting re-positioned shapes look like
# Wedge and Square are both -1,-1 to 1, 1 (you can open up the .json files to see what the vertex locations are)
